Focusing on the dependability of complex software systems, my research interests include software analysis, testing, automated program repair and vulnerablity detection. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Nanjing University in 2021 (supervisor Prof. Xuandong Li, Tian Zhang and Minxue Pan). Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. degree, also from Nanjing University. Between 2017 and 2018, I studied in the Department of Computer Sciences at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) (supervisor Prof. Yu Pei).
